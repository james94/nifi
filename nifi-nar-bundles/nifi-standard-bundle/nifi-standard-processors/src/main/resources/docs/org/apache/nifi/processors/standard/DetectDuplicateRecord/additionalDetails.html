    <p>This processor makes use of the NiFi RecordPath Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to allow the user to
        indicate which field(s) in the Record should be used to determine uniqueness. Users do this by adding
        a User-defined Property to the Processor's configuration. The name of the User-defined Property must
        be the RecordPath text that should be evaluated against each Record. All of the values identified by
        the record paths are hashed together in the order they were specified to derive a unique value
        representing a single Record. This hashed value is then optionally stored in the cache for
        subsequent FlowFile processing.</p>
    <p>If a RecordPath is given and does not match any field in an input Record, that Property will be
        skipped and all other Properties will still be evaluated. If the RecordPath matches no fields the
        record will be routed to the 'non-duplicate' relationship. If no User-defined Properties specifying
        a RecordPath are defined, all field values of the record will be used.</p>
    <p>After all RecordPath values are resolved, the values are combined in the order of the User-defined
        Properties and hashed together using the specified hashing algorithm, ensuring constant space per record.</p>

    <h2>Choosing a Filter Type</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Below, we lay out some examples in order to provide clarity about the Processor's behavior.
        For all of the examples below, consider the example to operate on the following set of 2 (JSON) records:</p>
    <code>
    <pre>
        [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "name": "John",
                "gender": "M",
            },
            {
                "id": 2,
                "name": "Susan",
                "gender": "F",
            },
            {
                "id": 3,
                "name": "Megan",
                "gender": "F",
            },
            {
                "id": 2,
                "name": "Jerry",
                "gender": "M",
            },
        ]
    </pre>
    </code>

    <h3>Example 1: Matching on a Single Record Field</h3>
    <p>A valid property RecordPath mapping would be <em>/id => ${field.value}</em>.</p>
    <p>For a record set with JSON like that, the records will be evaluated against the <code>id</code> field
        to determine uniqueness.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>non-duplicate:</strong> John, Susan, Megan</li>
        <li><strong>duplicate:</strong> Jerry</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example 2: Matching on Multiple Record Fields</h3>
    <p>If we wanted to define these records to be unique based on the <code>id</code> and <code>gender</code> fields,
        we would specify two RecordPath mappings: <em>/id => ${field.value}</em> and <em>/gender => ${field.value}</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>non-duplicate:</strong> John, Susan, Megan, Jerry</li>
        <li><strong>duplicate:</strong> <em>None</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example 3: Matching on All Record Fields</h3>
    <p>Do not define any RecordPath properties in the processor to use all fields by default.</p>
    <p>For a record set with JSON like that, the records will be evaluated against the <code>id, name, gender</code>
        fields to determine uniqueness.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>non-duplicate:</strong> John, Susan, Megan, Jerry</li>
        <li><strong>duplicate:</strong> <em>None</em></li>
    </ul>
